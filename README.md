# Hackage distro data for Fedora

https://hackage.haskell.org tracks the package versions in various
[distros](https://hackage.haskell.org/distros/) including Fedora.

These are manually uploaded using the fhpkg from
[fedora-haskell-tools](https://hackage.haskell.org/distros/).

The versions in the latest Fedora branch are tracked.
